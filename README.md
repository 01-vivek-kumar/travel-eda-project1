# Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering on Travel Dataset

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering** on the **Travel** dataset.  
The goal is to **understand the data, identify patterns, handle missing values, detect outliers, and create meaningful features** to enhance predictive modeling.  

### ðŸ”¹ Key Objectives:  
- **Data Ingestion** â€“ Loading and understanding the dataset.  
- **Data Cleaning** â€“ Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Uncovering insights through visualizations.  
- **Feature Engineering** â€“ Creating new features to improve model performance.  

By the end of this project, the dataset will be transformed into a **cleaned and enriched version** ready for **further modeling or analysis**.

## ðŸ”„ Data Ingestion & Preprocessing  

Before performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the dataset was **cleaned and preprocessed** to handle inconsistencies and missing values. This step ensures that our dataset is structured, reliable, and ready for further analysis.  

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Data Loading & Initial Exploration  
The dataset was loaded using **pandas**, and basic exploratory commands were used to understand its structure:  

```python
import pandas as pd  
df = pd.read_csv("Travel.csv")  
df.shape  # Check dataset dimensions  
df.head()  # View first five rows  
df.info()  # Check data types and missing values  
df.dtypes  # Identify column data types  
df.columns  # List all column names  


Observations:

The dataset contains 4888 rows and 10+ columns.
Some categorical features have inconsistent values (e.g., "Fe Male" instead of "Female").
Missing values exist in some columns, requiring handling.

```
### ðŸ”¹ 2. Handling Missing Values
```python
df.isnull().sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
```
Findings:
Columns like TypeofContact and MonthlyIncome had significant missing values.
Instead of using imputation, rows with missing values were dropped, since they were a small percentage of the dataset.

 ```python
df.dropna(axis=0, inplace=True)  # Remove rows with missing values  
df.isnull().sum()  # Verify missing values are handled
```
Post-cleaning, the dataset had 4000+ rows, ensuring a clean dataset for analysis.

###ðŸ”¹ 3. Fixing Data Inconsistencies

Upon checking categorical values, inconsistencies were found in Gender, where "Fe Male" was incorrectly recorded. This was corrected as follows:

```python
df.replace("Fe Male", "Female", inplace=True)  
df.Gender.unique()  # Verify changes
Other categorical inconsistencies were checked and handled similarly.
```

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Identifying Categorical & Numerical Features  

After handling missing values and fixing inconsistencies, the next step was to categorize the features into **categorical** and **numerical** groups.  

Since **all columns were initially stored as numeric data types**, some categorical features were mapped using numerical values. These columns needed to be identified and treated accordingly for accurate analysis.  

To separate them:  

```python
categorical_features = [
    "TypeofContact", "Occupation", "MaritalStatus", 
    "Gender", "ProductPitched", "Designation"
]

numerical_features = [
    "Age", "DurationOfPitch", "NumberOfPersonVisiting", 
    "NumberOfTrips", "NumberOfChildrenVisiting", "MonthlyIncome"
]
```

## ðŸ”„ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Univariate Analysis  

Univariate analysis focuses on examining each feature **individually** to understand its distribution and unique characteristics.  

#### ðŸ”¸ Categorical Features Distribution  

To analyze categorical features, **count plots** were used to visualize the frequency of each category. This helps in identifying **dominant categories, class imbalances, and potential insights**.  

For example, the distribution of the **target variable** `ProdTaken` (whether a customer purchased the product or not) was analyzed:  

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
sns.countplot(x='ProdTaken', data=df, palette='plasma')
plt.show()
```

To efficiently analyze the distribution of categorical columns, I plotted **count plots** for each feature. This helped me understand **category frequencies, potential class imbalances, and customer preferences**.  

Instead of manually plotting each feature, I used a **for loop** to automate the process:  

```python

for cat_column in cats:
  plt.figure(figsize = (8,5))
  sns.countplot(x = cat_column, data = df, palette = 'viridis')
  plt.title(f'Countplot(Univariate Analysis) for {cat_column}')
  plt.show()
```

By plotting all categorical columns at once, I was able to get a comprehensive view of data distribution, making it easier to spot patterns and irregularities.

The ProdTaken countplot shows that the majority of customers (0) did not purchase the product, with only a smaller proportion (1) making a purchase. This indicates a low conversion rate, suggesting potential issues in marketing, pricing, or customer interest.

The **CityTier** distribution shows that most customers belong to **Tier 1 cities**, followed by **Tier 3**, while **Tier 2 cities** have the least representation. This suggests that the business is primarily targeting or attracting customers from **highly developed urban areas**.

Most customers prefer 3-star properties, while 4-star and 5-star properties have a significantly lower but nearly equal preference. This suggests that affordability and mid-range accommodations are more popular among the target audience.

A majority of customers do not have a passport, which may indicate a stronger focus on domestic travel rather than international travel.

A larger proportion of customers own a car, which could indicate a preference for road trips or self-driven travel rather than relying on public transportation or flights.

The most common Pitch Satisfaction Score is 3, indicating that a majority of customers have a neutral opinion about their experience. However, there is also a significant proportion of customers who rated it as 1 or 5, suggesting a mix of highly dissatisfied and highly satisfied customers.

The majority of contacts are from Self Enquiry, meaning most customers are reaching out on their own rather than being invited by the company. This could indicate a strong interest from customers but might also mean that proactive outreach by the company is limited.

The majority of customers are salaried employees and small business owners, while freelancers and large business owners are significantly fewer. This suggests that the product/service is more appealing to working professionals and small entrepreneurs rather than large businesses or independent freelancers.

More male customers than female.

Married customers dominate; Singles & Unmarried may be untapped.
